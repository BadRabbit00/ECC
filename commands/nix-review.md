# /nix-review

Invoke **nix-reviewer** on `$ARGUMENTS` or `git diff -- '*.nix'`. If the change also touched other languages, run their reviewers separately with an explicit scope (e.g. `python-reviewer` on `backend/**/*.py`); the Nix reviewer handles only `.nix` and generated files.

Expect findings by severity with file:line, lint output, and a ship/fix-first verdict. Fix CRITICAL and HIGH before continuing; list MEDIUM/LOW for the user.
